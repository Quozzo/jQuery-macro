jquery.fn
===

*A collection of jQuery plugins*

**Note**: This is an old repo. These plugins are not being actively developed, and they're
mostly small and simple enough for anyone familiar with JS/jQuery/DOM to understand.
If something's broken, I recommend looking into the code. It's nice to know how stuff
works anyway... 

###Containing:

 * [Macro][1]
 
 
###Licenses

As of 2013 these plugins are released to the public domain under [UNLICENSE](http://unlicense.org/UNLICENSE).
